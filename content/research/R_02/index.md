title: Advanced temporal analysis methods
summary: 'We will develop and validate temporal fluctuation analysis methods to extract molecule-specific physical quantities. This will involve integrating microrheology-based approaches and flow-field analysis to quantify viscoelastic properties, material density, diffusion mode, and dynamic flow characteristics at the nanoscale.'
